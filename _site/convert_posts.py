Not a huge surprise - that's the general consensus.

Adjusted for inflation, the average ticket price in 1989 was $7.59. In 2014, it's $8.12. That's a 7% increase - as in, not a huge change at all. The problem with this dataset is obviously the lack of granularity - New York City tickets are probably increasing more dramatically, likely due to rent increases well above inflation - but this gives you an idea for across the US.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/onethirtyseven.herokuapp.com\/interactive\/movie_tickets_page\/#movie_tickets_change_graph\"\u003EYear over year, the change in price is slowing down.\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;Year-over-year change in prices peaked in 1999. The 2013-2014 change in price was the lowest since 1993 (adjusted for inflation, 2011 was lower - but both were negative). This could be a result of the shift toward streaming, VOD, etc. - but it's still very slight.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/onethirtyseven.herokuapp.com\/interactive\/movie_tickets_page\/#movie_tickets_sold_graph\"\u003EBut people are going to the movies less.\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;Number of tickets sold peaked in \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boxofficemojo.com\/yearly\/chart\/?yr=2002\u0026amp;p=.htm\"\u003E2002\u003C\/a\u003E (\u003Ci\u003ESpider-Man, Lord of The Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter\u003C\/i\u003E, and \u003Ci\u003EMy Big Fat Greek Wedding \u003C\/i\u003Ewere the top five movies that year - all five of which, if adjusted for ticket price increase, would've been the top movie of 2014).

(Other strange things - \"Last Updated 12\/31\/1969,\" \"#1 Movie: ' '\", etc.) But even though it's back, the amount of uproar\/confusion (at least within the film reporting community) only serves to highlight the importance it plays in providing a huge amount of movie data (financial and otherwise) and how easy it would be for IMDb\/Amazon to pull it away.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nBut the question is, how do you completely reproduce that level of data? Where do you get it (in a legitimate way)?

It's the depth of the dataset (having daily box office for a movie) and the breadth of their coverage (effectively all movies released in the last 15 years) that would be difficult, but not impossible, to reassemble elsewhere. To be honest, though - as long as there is a legitimate, trusted, separate source for this data, it's really not that hard to put together (it's really, in the grand scheme of things, not that much data).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithcalder\/status\/520669790071820289\"\u003EThis conversation\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;among a few involved in the film industry - bloggers, producers, interested people - reinforces the idea that an independent source of this data is crucial.

It's taken much longer than I wanted, but I should hopefully have something soon. But I'm now compelled to write at least a quick post.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nAt some point yesterday, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boxofficemojo.com\/\"\u003EBox Office Mojo\u003C\/a\u003E, undoubtedly the premier source for movie financial data, completely disappeared. Like, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Leftovers_(TV_series)\"\u003EThe Leftovers\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;disappeared. (If you click on the link, you're taken to the IMDb box office page.) This is a huge deal - admittedly personally, in that it is an unrivaled and incredibly rich data source for movies, and so was the perfect source for real movie data analysis - but also for the industry. There are a bunch of articles on the subject - \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.hypable.com\/2014\/10\/10\/box-office-mojo-shut-down\/\"\u003Ethis one\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;has some seriously distressed reactions about it, and rightly so. The film industry is incredibly secretive, or at least insular, when it comes to financial data - see \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hollywood_accounting\"\u003Ethis Wikipedia page on \"Hollywood accounting\",\u003C\/a\u003E an actual term someone made up to soften the idea that Hollywood studios routinely make up numbers to avoid paying those involved (for example, \u003Ci\u003EMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\u003C\/i\u003E, a film that reportedly cost $5mm to make and grossed $600mm worldwide, lost $20mm according to the studio).\u0026nbsp;So to lose an entire source of movie financial data - and not only a source, THE source - is, at the very least, a serious blow to those reporting on the numbers, and at most, a worrisome move toward further financial\/data-related secrecy in the movie industry.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nNo one knows yet what will happen to it; IMDb did buy the site years ago, but left it intact. IMDb is owned by Amazon - which seems strange in that the two sites could not seem more unrelated, and doesn't inspire confidence that they will be as open with the data as Box Office Mojo had been. This is well within their rights - they own the data and can do whatever they want with it - but it's seriously concerning to anyone relying on the data. But who knows - maybe they'll have a bigger, better, and more open site, with more advanced analysis, interactive charts, legitimate historical context, and an API. (They may completely replace what I'm trying to do here - but hey, then at least someone will be using the huge amount of data there in a sophisticated way.) Until then, I'd recommend using\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.the-numbers.com\/\"\u003EThe Numbers\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003Cspan id=\"goog_675414670\"\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan id=\"goog_675414671\"\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/\"\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E- they track the same data, it's unfortunately just not as rich (no international data, and historical data is a bit spotty).

Let's take the best seat in the house - center, to the middle (you can argue that forever - but let's just assume it is). This seat always starts at $10, and can be as expensive as $15. Other seats have different ranges, based on what's most popular. The price changes as two things change - days until the screening, and the number of tickets already bought. So the most expensive ticket you'll ever buy is the $15 best seat in the house, as the last ticket, on the day of the screening. As tickets are bought elsewhere in the theater for that screening, the price of that seat goes up and up - the movie is clearly in demand.

It's worth thinking about in more detail (believe me - I intend to).

It's really a follow-up to my last post - it takes the gross of all movies on a given day as a percentage of the total gross in that day. But now you can actually see what makes up the chart - and see, for example, how \u003Ci\u003EThe Hobbit\u003C\/i\u003E\u0026nbsp;made up about half of the money spent on its opening weekend, but faded fast, while \u003Ci\u003EFrozen's \u003C\/i\u003Erun has lasted for months.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe second thing I added was several ways to look at the data: by Movie (like above), by Studio, by MPAA Rating, by Genre, and by Month of Release. You can click any of those titles to change the chart to that classification. This data is all taken directly from Box Office Mojo - again, they do a great job with storing all of this data (though their genres need a little work).\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nFor example - here I'm looking at how much of the domestic box office revenue was accounted for by PG-13 movies (after clicking MPAA Rating):\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-TjsJRgmUF0c\/UyYz9TZkWhI\/AAAAAAAAAJ0\/qMhim5YdqdQ\/s1600\/rating.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-TjsJRgmUF0c\/UyYz9TZkWhI\/AAAAAAAAAJ0\/qMhim5YdqdQ\/s1600\/rating.png\" height=\"258\" width=\"640\" \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nMonth of Release is the one I wanted to highlight - it shows the gross accounted for by movies released in a particular month.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-pi-iLumrU6Y\/UyY1_LsRw8I\/AAAAAAAAAKA\/I3YOUe6VmrY\/s1600\/releasemonth.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-pi-iLumrU6Y\/UyY1_LsRw8I\/AAAAAAAAAKA\/I3YOUe6VmrY\/s1600\/releasemonth.png\" height=\"252\" width=\"640\" \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003EAll of these would be much more interesting over a much longer period of time, but this one would be more than anything. It's really showing two things: how well movies released in one month do in the subsequent months, and how poorly movies do in their month of release. In the chart above, the dark green is December movies, and the light green is January movies. Not a shock to anyone - movies released in January are generally expected to perform terribly (and are usually, with some exceptions, terribly received), and movies released in December are generally either pushed for the Oscars or expected to be blockbusters. But, it's another thing to have the numbers verify that.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003EAgain, this is a short timeframe and has very little to say in the way of real trends across time. There are only around 50-100 movies regularly tracked in the domestic box office - a relatively small sample size - and the list only incrementally changes. Moreover, the makeup of the box office changes drastically from month to month and from season to season; January looks very different from March, and spring very different from summer. That makes it harder to intuit real changes - you'd need to look at multiple seasons and years for true trends to take hold. But that, in short, is one of the major points I'm attempting to investigate.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n________________________________________________________________________\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\"\u003EData source: \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boxofficemojo.com\/\"\u003EBox Office Mojo\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\/sup\u003ENot \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0116000\/\"\u003Ethis\u003C\/a\u003E D3.\u003C\/span\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/137to1.blogspot.com\/feeds\/1361507331754750379\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/137to1.blogspot.com\/2014\/03\/the-box-office-interactive-chart.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/5603465652147875481\/posts\/default\/1361507331754750379?v=2"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/5603465652147875481\/posts\/default\/1361507331754750379?v=2"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/137to1.blogspot.com\/2014\/03\/the-box-office-interactive-chart.html","title":"The Box Office: An Interactive Chart"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Jim Shields"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/106320063584800230328"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/-WOz-6ywwWHU\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAUg\/JdRKDWAvekA\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-TjsJRgmUF0c\/UyYz9TZkWhI\/AAAAAAAAAJ0\/qMhim5YdqdQ\/s72-c\/rating.png","height":"72","width":"72"},"thr$total":{"$t":"0"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DEUARHo-fSp7ImA9Wh9XFks.\"","id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5603465652147875481.post-6159618089541690122"},"published":{"$t":"2014-03-12T19:16:00.000-04:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2014-03-12T19:17:25.455-04:00"},"app$edited":{"xmlns$app":"http://www.w3.org/2007/app","$t":"2014-03-12T19:17:25.455-04:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"2014"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Box Office"}],"title":{"$t":"A Different Way to Analyze the Box Office"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003ENormally, analysis of the domestic box office in order to discern any meaningful insight is difficult.

The correlation is highest (64%) between the change in average gross and the change in viewership in millions of people.

But to get back to the question of whether anyone will watch tonight's Oscars - according to these numbers, fewer people will, given that, on average, the films have grossed less.

One, it's relatively rare for no nominees, within a single category, to come from Best Picture nominees (~3.5% of the time - just a little more common than full overlap within a category).

But it demonstrates the disparity more starkly - on average, 2.7 Best Actor nominees appear in Best Picture nominees, while 1.8 Best Actress nominees do the same.

Much more often, historically, Best Actress nominees have come from \"smaller\" films - films like \u003Ci\u003EThe Impossible\u003C\/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003EAlbert Nobbs\u003C\/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003ERabbit Hole\u003C\/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003EJulie and Julia\u003C\/i\u003E, or \u003Ci\u003ERachel Getting Married,\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003Ejust to pick an example for each of the five previous years. Keep in mind that I'm doing just that - picking notable, recent examples - which does not in any way prove an overall trend (though as the data shows in aggregate, there does exist a consistent trend, with lots of examples). Or, the equally troubling answer - films featuring prominent, strongly-performed female roles are under recognized when it comes to nominating Best Pictures.

Most interesting is that the distribution of hits seems to be expanding over the years. Essentially, the top 1 and 5 movies of each year have represented less and less of the total domestic take, while the top 25, 50, and 100 movies have represented more of the total. The concentration of the top 100 movies, in particular, are over 120% of the concentration of the top 100 movies of 1982. If there's one conclusion to draw from this, it's that there are more and more worthy movies being released to the public - or, at the very least, studios and distributors are getting better and better at getting people to see specific movies (2013 being a great example - 31 different films crossed the $100 million mark, which may or may not still be a meaningful marker for success).\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003EThis is somewhat affected by an outlier in 1982 - \u003Ci\u003EE.T.\u003C\/i\u003E - which represented 9% of all box office receipts in that year.

Given the year-over-year change for each of the above - this is that change, compounded, since 1982. Put very simply - total gross in 2013 sits at 316% - this means it is 316% of the 1982 total gross. More importantly, the average tickets sold per movie in 2013 is at an all-time low of 72% of 1982's average tickets sold. And the trend continues down.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003EYou can see how all five of these stats - total gross, number of movies, average ticket price, average gross per movie, and average tickets sold per movie - have changed relative to each other. And here's where it's most clear that the $10.9 billion grossed domestically in 2013 - again, the largest ever - is due almost entirely to the increase in ticket prices and the increase in the number of movies. What this means is that the market continues to become more and more saturated with movies, while each of those movies sells fewer and fewer tickets. One could argue the causes - it has been increasingly easy to make a movie, distribution methods have shifted away from a wide release in theaters, there are a significant number of alternative options to going to the movies (including, but not limited to, Netflix and other streaming options and a better and wider selection of TV), there may be an increasing lack of interest in going to the movies altogether - but the effect is the same. While there may be more movies than ever before, fewer and fewer people are going to see each one.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E__________________________________________________________________\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/sup\u003EMoney made in domestic markets - US and Canada.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/sup\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.hitfix.com\/awards-campaign\/lessons-from-the-2013-box-office-top-20-movies-of-the-year\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E3\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/sup\u003EImportant note: I'm using \u003Ci\u003EEpic \u003C\/i\u003Eand \u003Ci\u003ENow You See Me\u003C\/i\u003E\u0026nbsp;as punchlines, but I didn't see either of them.

It's extremely important to note that this is considerably skewed by the fact that there can now be more than 5 Best Picture nominees (like the years prior to 1944), and due to that, it is significantly harder for 100% overlap in the years between (there would have to be perfect matchup - 5 to 5 or multiple nominees in the same category for the same film).

While average is hardly a\nperfect measure to use, it at least allows for all of the years since the\nexpansion to be considered.
