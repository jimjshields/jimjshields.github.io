Hi, I'm Jim. I love movies, programming, and data, among other things.

I blogged a lot in 2014 and 2015, when I was learning programming on my own and attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (shameless plug, [go apply!](https://www.recurse.com/apply)). At the time, I was excited to write about movies & data and my experience learning programming.

Since then, I've been working as a data engineer, engineering manager, internal tools engineer, infrastructure engineer, and other roles at [YipitData](http://yipitdata.com), which has been great and I've learned a lot! But I've only rarely blogged or worked on personal projects.

This is an effort to start again â€” I want to keep writing about what excites me, which might be movies, data, programming, or something else.

Here are some small projects I've worked on:
* [Thank the Academy](https://thanktheacademy.herokuapp.com/): a Markov generator for Academy Awards acceptance speeches. This was really fun! But the graphs don't work anymore :(.
* [1.37:1](https://onethirtyseven.herokuapp.com/interactive/): a small site where I played around with simple visualizations of movie data (box office & ticket prices).
* [Tiny](https://github.com/jimjshields/tiny): a web framework I built in Python during my time at RC. I learned a lot from this.
* [Rotten Tomatoes CLI](https://github.com/jimjshields/rotten_tomatoes_CLI): A command-line interface I built for the Rotten Tomatoes API. Mostly an excuse to play around with their API, but it was really cool to work on!
